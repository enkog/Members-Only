# Project :  Members Only
The aim of this project is to master the use of the devise gem in rails for authentication and authorization. I built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Build-With

- Ruby -v 2.7.1
- Rails -v 6.0.3.4
